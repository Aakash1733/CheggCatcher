# CheggCatcher
This Selenium based web automation tool is used to alert Chegg Educators for any new question as and when it arrives . As this solves the biggest problem for the Educators who have to wait long to get a question through automated systems and no alert is present in the original system.

Run Chegg2.py as the main file and add your smtp mail credentials and Email ID in the other file.
